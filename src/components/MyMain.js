        My name is Muhammad Java. I am a web developer from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 
        Growing up I enjoyed playing video games and sports like basketball and football with my brother and our cousins.
        Now that I'm older, the love for those hobbies hasn't changed
        I always was interested in how things worked, especially electronics, and this led to me pursuing a career in coding.
